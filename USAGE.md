# Workflow: The 5-Minute Rule

1. Fetch content → saved as .txt in ~/.local/share/llmfeed/
2. Within 5 minutes, use AI tabs (Summarize, Classify, etc.)
3. After 5 minutes, old files are skipped automatically.

Example: Paste https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html → Scrape → Summarize within 5 min.
